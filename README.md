# about seeds of creativity

We are a non-profit art incubator. Artists can use our services to create and promote their art. The focus of this non-profit is primarily on people with disabilities and their equity within the art community. We believe there is talent that is not found do to inadequate resources and ineffective support. 

As an art incubator, we will offer free services to people with disabilities to help them in their development as an artist 
and creation and promotion of their art.

# goal of this website

This software will be used primarily for public outreach and focused on three tracks. 

Information: we live in an world defined by its information, and this software will be dedicated providing clear and helpful information to the public, regarding the non-profit. 

Promotion: our artist have been overlooked for too long. This site will function as a means to discover our artists. We will lead to public to the individual sites of our respective artist, providing them with just enough information to draw their attention, but acting only as proxy to our artist.

Support: lets face it, we have a big task ahead of us. We will need the support of the community. In this modern age, the community means anyone with a computer and internet. This website will be a place to learn about how to support the organization in all the different capacities.
